# stop-windows-10-auto-update
This is a simple CLI (to be run in Administrator mood) to stop windows update

Right click on it, RUN as Administrator ! Boom!

Save in Desktop, each time you connect to the Internet, RUN!
I will be giving a permanent solution soon (Firewall) 



EDIT:

After importing the firewall file, run the batch again as administrator
